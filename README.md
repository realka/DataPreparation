# Data Preparation
Data Preparation Tools for Deep Learning which I used for it.
There are some Python code for prepare data for Deep Learning which i used for my master project.
Enjoy it!


You can use Random Image Select for split train and test image with code.

You can use Renamer for rename all images. For example: 124512.jpg -> 1-car.jpg .

You can use csv builder for create csv files for Deep Learning with images.

You can use CSV Builder tor create zip for Deep Learning Studio (Deep Cognition).

You can use Retinex to create filtered imagesets (Retinex, AutomatedRetinex, MSRCP).

Filters.py contains a lot of cv2 filters. You can use it for data preparation before Machine Learning methods.

They are working with multi folder.
